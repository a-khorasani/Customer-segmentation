# Customer-segmentation
The Mall customers dataset contains information about people visiting the mall. The dataset has gender, customer id, age, annual income, and spending score. It collects insights from the data and group customers based on their behaviors. I analyzed the data and after that I used KMeans algorityhm to segment the customers into 5 cluster.
